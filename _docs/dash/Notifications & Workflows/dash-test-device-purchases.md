If you used the `is_test_device:true` flag in your LWA registration event, DRS will treat this as a test device. A replenish API call for a test device will generate a "trial purchase," which simulates a purchase event, including applicable notifications, without charging the customer’s payment instrument or shipping a consumable.

The Order Placed and Item Shipped SNS notifications will be sent. Trial purchases cannot be canceled and will not appear in the customer’s Amazon.com order history.

A test order can be canceled by calling a [CancelTestOrder API][dash-canceltestorder-endpoint]. The standard order can be canceled by customers through their Amazon account.

### JavaScript Sample Request
