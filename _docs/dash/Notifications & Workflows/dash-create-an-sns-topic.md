 The Dash Replenishment Service (DRS) uses SNS Topics to notify you (the device maker) of changes to device status, order state, subscription status, and more.

 [Amazon's Simple Notification Service (SNS)](https://aws.amazon.com/sns/) is a pub-sub service from AWS that makes it easy to set up, manage, and send messages instantly to applications or users. See [Notification Messages][dash-notification-messages] for a complete listing of supported DRS notifications.
